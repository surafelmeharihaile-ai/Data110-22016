### Objective
The goal of this assignment is to build your Markdown skills and apply them in a real-world platform: **GitHub**. You will create a GitHub account (if you haven’t already), set up a repository, and practice using various Markdown formatting elements.

### Instructions

#### 1. Create Your GitHub Account (If You Don’t Have One)
- Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
- Click on **Sign Up** in the top right corner.
- Follow the prompts to create your account:
  - Choose a username.
  - Provide your email address.
  - Set a secure password.
- Once your account is created, confirm your email address.

#### 2. Navigate to Your Repository
- If you already created a repository in class, log in to your GitHub account and navigate to your repository (e.g., `Data110`).
- If you haven’t created a repository yet:
  - Click on the **“+”** icon at the top right of your GitHub page and select **"New repository"**.
  - Name your repository `Data110`.
  - Choose "Public" for the visibility and click **Create repository**.

#### 3. Create a New Markdown File
- In your repository, click on **“Add file”** and select **“Create new file”**.

#### 4. Practice Markdown Formatting
In your newly created `Markdown-Exercise.md` file, practice Markdown by including the following:

- **Author Section**: At the top of your file, create a section called **“Author”** and include your name and the current date.
  
- **Headers**: Use different levels of headers to organize your content.
  
- **Emphasis**: Add examples of **bold** and *italic* text.
  
- **Lists**: Create both an ordered list (1, 2, 3) and an unordered list (bullet points).
  
- **Links**: Insert a hyperlink to a website of your choice.
  
- **Images**: Include an image. You can use any online image URL or something personal like a picture of your pet or favorite place.
  
- **Blockquotes**: Add a quote you love using the blockquote syntax.
  
- **Inline Code & Code Blocks**: Demonstrate inline code and code blocks using `backticks` and triple backticks.
  
- **Tables**: Create a simple table (e.g., one that compares different programming languages or hobbies).
  
- **Task Lists**: Make a task list (e.g., new year resolutions) and check off any that you’ve already completed.
  
- **Footnotes**: Add a footnote at the end of your document explaining something further.

Feel free to be creative! You can write about your favorite hobby, a project idea, or anything else that excites you.

#### 5. Commit Your New File
- After finishing your Markdown file, scroll to the **"Commit new file"** section.
- Write a commit message describing your changes, such as "Add Markdown-Exercise.md."
